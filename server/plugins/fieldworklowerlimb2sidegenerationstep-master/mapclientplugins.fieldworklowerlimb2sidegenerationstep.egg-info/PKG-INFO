Description: an articulated shape model.
        
        The articulated model can be automatically registered to landmarks through
        shape and pose optimisation to minimise the least squares distance between 
        model landmarks and input target landmarks. Alternatively, models can be
        manually generated by adjusting principal component weights and joint angles.
        
        The step uses an articulated lower limb shape model containing the pelvis, left
        and right femurs, tibias, fibulas, and patellas. The shapes of all bones are
        controlled by one PCA-based shape model. The relative orientation of the bones
        are controlled by a 6 dof (3 trans, 3 rot) ground-pelvis joint, 2 3-rotational
        dof ball-and-socket hip joints, and 2 1-rotational dof knee joints. The 
        tibia, fibula, and patella are considered as 1 rigid body. The model will
        attempt to maintain a tibio-femoral joint spacing of 5.0 mm at whatever knee
        angle to account for cartilage thickness.

        Usage
        -----
        This step is intended to produce a set of lower limb bone meshes by registering a lower limb shape model to a sparse set of landmarks corresponding to lower limb bony anatomical landmarks. The model can also be manual posed and shape without running any registration.
        
        This step has a workflow-runtime GUI in which the model can be viewed adjusted and registered. The GUI can also be disabled in which case the step will attempt to automatically registered the model to the configured landmarks.
        
        ### Landmarks
        If the lowerlimb model is being fitted to a set of landmarks, there should be at least 1 input landmark per bone in the lowerlimb model. An ideal minimal set of landmarks should be the left and right anterior superior iliac spines on the pelvis, the midpoint of the left and right posterior superior iliac spines (Sacral), medial and lateral epicondyles for the left and right femur, medial and lateral malleolii for the left and right tibia and fibula. Additional landmarks, particularly on the proximal femur and proximal tibia, should improve bone shape prediction. If the pelvis-LASIS, pelvis-RASIS, and pelvis-Sacral landmarks are among the defined landmarks, the model can be registered fully automatically.
        
        ### Registration
        In the configuration dialogue (before executing the workflow) or in the runtime GUI in the *Landmarks* tab, select the set of model landmarks to be fitted to their corresponding input landmarks. Before running registration by clicking the *Register* button, a number of registration parameters can be adjusted. See the Configurations and Step GUI sections for details on each parameter.
        
        If the pelvis-LASIS, pelvis-RASIS, and pelvis-Sacral landmarks are among the defined landmarks, click the *Register* button to automatically register the model to the landmarks. If the three pelvis landmarks are not present, coarse manual registration of the model to the target landmarks is required before clicking *Register*.
        
        Once registration is complete, the GUI will unlock and registration errors will be displayed. After registration, the model can be manually adjusted using controls in the _Manual Registration_ tab. To revert the model to its original state, click *Reset*. To output the current model, click *Accept*.
        
        ### Manual Registration
        The _Manual Registration_ tab allows the model to be translated, rotated, posed, and deformed along its principal components. To produce a model completely manually, adjust the controls in the tab until satisfied, then click *Accept*.
        
        To manually align the model before automatic registration, adjust pelvis translation and rotation to bring the model within ~5 cm of pelvis target landmarks. Joint angles can be adjusted by is usually not necessary if target joint angles are less than 20 degrees from the model. After manual adjustments, open the _Auto Registration_ tab to configure and run auto registration.
        
        To manually adjust the model after auto registration, open the _Manual Registration_ tab after auto registration completes. Click _Accept_ to output the model after manual adjustments.
        
        Configurations
        --------------
        - **identifier** : Unique name for the step.
        - **Registration Mode**: How bone model shapes are adjusted during registration.
            Only shape changes via the shape model is currently supported.
        - **PCs to Fit** : Number of principal components to adjust bone shape along 
            during registration. It is advisable to perform registration first with 1
            PC to encourage pose and size matching, then increasing to  5 PCs to fine
            tune bone shape.
        - **Mahalanobis Weight** : Weighting on the Mahalanobis distance penalty term
            during registration. Higher weights penalise more against shape far
            from the mean. Value should be between 0.1 and 1.0.
        - **Landmarks** : Add and remove model-target landmark pairs to be used for model 
            registration. Each entry is a model - target landmark pair. The model 
            landmark should be selected from the set of supported landmarks (see 
            Supported Landmarks section below). The target landmark should be the 
            exact name of the  corresponding landmark in the input landmark dictionary
            (e.g. marker name from a TRC file).
        - **Marker Radius** : Radius of the markers used for motion capture input landmarks.
            This value is used to correct the input landmark positions to match the
            bone-surface model landmarks. If input landmarks are already on the
            bone surface, enter 0.0.
        - **Skin Padding** : The soft-tissue thickness between skin surface markers and
            the underlying bone surface. This value is used to correct the input
            landmark positions to match the bone-surface model landmarks. If input
            landmarks are already on the bone surface, enter 0.0.
        - **Knee Options** : Optionally turn on abduction/adduction angle adjustment at the
            knee. The _Abd. DOF_ option enables the abduction angle as a degree of 
            freedom in the model registration optimisation. Enabling the option tends
            to improve registration errors. The _Abd. Correction_ option will enable a
            correction of knee abduction to maintain the 5 mm tibio-femoral joint
            spacing for both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee (highly
            experimental, may cause optimisation to become unstable).
        - **GUI** : Enable/disable the step GUI during workflow execution.
        
        All options except "identifier" and "GUI" can be adjusted during workflow
        execution in the step GUI if the GUI is enabled.
        
        
        Step GUI

            for model fitting and adjusted for marker radius and soft-tissue thickness.
        - **Visibles box** : Show or hide the lower limb model and input landmarks in
            the 3D scene.
        - **Landmarks tab** : Setup model-target landmarks for automatic registration.
            - Add and remove model-target landmark pairs to be used for model registration. 
                Each entry is a model - target landmark pair. The model landmark should
                be selected from the set of supported landmarks (see Supported Landmarks
                section below).
                The target landmark should be selected from the list of input landmark names.
            - **Marker Radius** : Radius of the markers used for motion capture input landmarks.
                This value is used to correct the input landmark positions to match the
                bone-surface model landmarks.
                If input landmarks are already on the bone surface, enter 0.0.
            - **Skin Padding** : The soft-tissue thickness between skin surface markers and the underlying bone surface.
                This value is used to correct the input landmark positions to match the bone-surface model landmarks.
                If input landmarks are already on the bone surface, enter 0.0.
        - **Manual Registration tab** : Manually adjust model shape and orientation parameters.

            - **Hip, Knee Rot** : Hip and knee joint angles in their x, y, and z joint axes.
            - **Reset** : reset principal component weights and all rotations and translations to 0.
            - **Accept** : Finish execution of the step and output the currently configured model.
        - **Auto Registration tab** : Configure and run automatic model registration to landmarks. 
            - **Registration Mode**: How bone model shapes are adjusted during registration.
                Only shape changes via the shape model is currently supported.
            - **PCs to Fit** : Number of principal components to adjust bone shape along 
                during registration. It is advisable to perform registration first with 1 PC to encourage pose and size matching, then increasing to  5 PCs to fine tune bone shape.

                during registration. Higher weights penalise more against shape far
                from the mean. Value should be between 0.1 and 1.0.
            - **Correct Knee Abd** : enable a correction of knee abduction to maintain the 5 mm tibio-femoral joint spacing for both the medial and lateral compartments of the knee (highly
                experimental).
            - **Fit Knee Abd** : enables the abduction angle as a degree of freedom in the model registration optimisation.
                Enabling the option tends to improve registration errors.
            - **Register** : Run model registration.
            - **Reset** : Reset principal component weights and all rotations and translations to 0.
            - **Abort** : Abort the workflow.
            - **Accept** : Finish execution of the step and output the currently configured model.
            - **Landmark Error** : Root-mean-squared distance between adjusted target
                landmarks and corresponding fitted model landmarks.
            - **Mahalanobis Distance** : The Mahalanobis distance of the fitted model. Higher values indicates a more unusual shape. Increasing the Mahalanobis Weight should reduce this number. The distance is calculated as sqrt(sum(z_i^2)) where z_i is the number of standard deviations from the mean of the fitted score of the i-th principal component.

              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.
